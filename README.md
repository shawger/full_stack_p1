## Summary

Small application that displays promo material (trailers and posters) for all currently playing movies.

[The Movie Database](www.themoviedb.org) is used to get the currently playing movies and to find the media related to them.

## Requirements

python 2.7 with the packages json and urllib2 installed (this should be default)

## Running the application

In a terminal run:
    python entertainment_center.py

That should be it. Warning, this does take a bit to gather all the info.
